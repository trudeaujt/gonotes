package integers

// Add When you have more than one argument of the same type, you can shorten it to x,y int!
// Although we learned about named return values in the last section, there is no need for that here.
// The reasoning is that the meaning of the result is clear from context (will add the parameters)
func Add(x, y int) int {
	return x + y
}
